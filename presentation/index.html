				<section>
          <h2>Hexagonal Architecture principles</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Separate User-Side, Business Logig and Server-Side</li>
            <li>Dependencies go to Business Logic</li>
            <li>Boundaries isolation with ports and adapters</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Why should you use Hexagonal Architecture ?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Code isolation</li>
            <li>Flexibility with adapters</li>
            <li>Test, maintenability and reusability are easier</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Some drawbacks</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>code may get fat</li>
            <li>no specific guidelines</li>
            <li>not easy to implement for every languages/framework</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>User-Side</h3>
          <p>
            It's the code that allows interactions and uses the business logic.
            <ul>
              <li>Controllers</li>
              <li>UI</li>
              <li>Tests</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Business Logic</h3>
          <p>
            This is where the magic happens.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Server-Side</h3>
          <p>
            These are services called by the business logic
            <ul>
              <li>data sources</li>
              <li>external services</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>How do we implement this for micro-services ?</h2>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Domains and routes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Routes: User-Side</li>
            <li>Domains: Business-Logic and Server-Side</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Routes</h3>
          <p>
            Routes are the entry points to our micro-services
            <br>
            They are responsibles of:
            <ul>
              <li>Checking request data</li>
              <li>Use the Business-Logic layer</li>
              <li>Do not have heavy logic</li>
              <li>Formatting response data</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Domains</h3>
          <p>
            Domains concentrate the code for the business logic and is splitted in:
            <ul>
              <li>libs</li>
              <li>helpers</li>
              <li>dals</li>
              <li>adapters</li>
              <li>converters</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>libs</h3>
          <p>
            Libs are at the top level and are the main entry points to the Business-Logic layer.
            <br><br>
            They can use dals, adapters, converters and helpers.
            <br><br>
            Libs should not be able to call one another.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>helpers</h3>
          <p>
            Unlike libs, helpers are at the bottom level and should not be responsible of heavy logic.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>dals</h3>
          <p>
            This is where the Data Access Layer code lies.
            <br><br>
            Dals only manage the data sources (database, JSON, files, ....)
            <br><br>
            Dals are part of the Server-Side layer and don't know how the Business-Logic works
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>adapters</h3>
          <p>
            At the moment and according to the adapter pattern, adapters are responsible to convert data types between Server-Side and Business-Logic.
            <br><br>
            BUT, in a Hexagonal Architecture context, adapters should embed the Dal and be the entry point of the Server-Side layer.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>converters</h3>
          <p>
            Converters allow us to convert types inside the Business-Logic layer.
          </p>

          <h2>Quick look at Clean Architecture</h2>
          <img src="img/clean_architecture.jpg" width="300px" />
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Clean Architecture principles</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Follows Clean Code principles, for architecture to be clean, code has to be clean</li>
            <li>Follows SOLID principles as Clean Code does</li>
            <li>Use the Dependency Inversion principle to place boundaries between high and low level components</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Quick words about SOLID</h3>
          <p>SOLID are the 5 principles of Object Oriented Design</p>
          <ul>
            <li>S - Single Responsability Principle</li>
            <li>O - Open/Closed Principle</li>
            <li>L - Liskov substitution Principle</li>
            <li>I - Interface Segregation Principle</li>
            <li>D - Dependency Inversion Principle</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Single Responsability Principle (S.R.P.)</h3>
          <blockquote>A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.</blockquote>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Open/Closed Principle</h3>
          <blockquote>Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification</blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li>A module is Opened until it is used, after that we should not modify it, only extend it</li>
            <li>A module is Closed since it is used by other modules</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Liskov Subsitution Principle</h3>
          <blockquote>Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.</blockquote>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Interface Segregation Principle</h3>
          <blockquote>No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use</blockquote>
          <p>You should be able to extend from an interface where you need all its exposed methods.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Dependency Inversion Principle</h3>
          <blockquote>Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.</blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li>Your high levels modules should be able to easily switch their low level modules.</li>
            <li>Enforces modules to use abstraction instead of concret implementations</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Why don't we use Clean Architecture yet ?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Imply to be more rigorous</li>
            <li>Code will get fatter then with Hexagonal, for example, we'll have adapters for routes response too, and you can switch between multiple adapters (JSON, XML, ...)</li>
          </ul>
